CoreData's concurrent stacks made easy.

> Inspired by
> [Concurrent Core Data Stacks][Performance] article,
> [WWDC2013 Session 211][HighPerformance]
> and [Seru][Seru] CoreData stack by [@kostiakoval][User].

## Usage

Initialize `StorageModel` (see also: [StorageModel.md][StorageModel.md])
```swift
func newPersistentStoreCoordinator() -> NSPersistentStoreCoordinator {
    // Create and return new persistent store coordinator
}

let storage = StorageModel(persistentStoreCoordinator: newPersistentStoreCoordinator)
```

Initialize `Roku` stack (see also: [Roku.md][Roku.md]) with base stack
```swift
let baseStack = Roku<BaseStack>(storage: storage)
```
or nested stack
```swift
let nestedStack = Roku<NestedStack>(storage: storage)
```
or independent stack.
```swift
let independentStack = Roku<IndependentStack>(storage: storage)
```

Be happy :]
```swift
nestedStack.withBackgroundContext { context in
    // Do heavy import operations on the background context
}

independentStack.withBackgroundContext { context in
    // Do another heavy import operations on the background context
}

nestedStack.mainObjectContext      // main queue context
independentStack.mainObjectContext // main queue context
```

## TODO
- [x] Implement observable NSManagedObjectContext.
- [x] Implement templates and default implementations.
- [ ] Implement all functionality of `Roku` class.
- [ ] Finish writing README.md file.
- [ ] Add examples of custom stack templates and implementations.
- [ ] Feature: implement manager for stack with multiple persistent store coordinators.
- [ ] Write unit tests.
