CoreData's concurrent stacks made easy.

### `StorageModel`
A small layer between `Roku` framework and the external services.

> `StorageModel` API is currently in development.

##### Usage

Initializing storage model (recomended).
```swift
func createPersistentStore() -> NSPersistentStoreCoordinator {
    // Create and return persistent store coordinator
}

let storage = StorageModel(persistentStoreCoordinator: createPersistentStore)
```

Overriding lazy initialization.
```swift
// By default, `StorageModel` uses lazy initialization of its values.
let dontBeLazy = false
let storage = StorageModel(persistentStoreCoordinator: createPersistentStore, lazyEvaluation: dontBeLazy)
```

###### Error handling

`Roku` relies on existence of persistent store coordinator.
Writing a lot of `guard` and `if`-`else` conditions and then letting the user
to handle the error was not the best solution.

`StorageModel`, by default initializes its properties to internal subclasses,
conforming to `NullObject` protocol.

You can get instances of those internal subclasses by calling
```swift
StorageModel.nullStore() // -> NSPersistentStoreCoordinator, NullObject
```
or
```swift
StorageModel.nullModel() // -> NSManagedObjectModel, NullObject
```

Example of handling errors on `StorageModel` initialization.
```swift
let storage = StorageModel()

// Initialization of persistent store coordinator...
// Don't assign any value to `persistentStoreCoordinator` if an error occurs

if storage.persistentStoreCoordinator is NullObject {
    // Persistent store coordinator was not initialized by user
    // Handle an error
}
```

##### Related protocols

###### `StorageModelConvertible`
Describes an object, that could be initialized with `StorageModel` instance.

###### `StorageModelBased`
Describes an object, that could be initialized with `StorageModel` instance
and its behavior relies on storage model.

###### `StorageModelBasedStack`
Describes a contexts stack that could be initialized with `StorageModel`
instance and its behavior relies on storage model.
Type alias of two protocols:
`BaseStackTemplate`
`StorageModelBased`
All default implementations conform to this protocol.
Your custom implementations have to conform to this protocol
to be used with `Roku` class.

## TODO
- [x] Implement observable NSManagedObjectContext.
- [x] Implement templates and default implementations.
- [ ] Implement all functionality of `Roku` class.
- [ ] Finish writing README.md file.
- [ ] Add examples of custom stack templates and implementations.
- [ ] Feature: implement manager for stack with multiple persistent store coordinators.
- [ ] Write unit tests.
