/// Default `CoreData` stack implementation.

/// with automatic changes merging is supported.
/// You may add as much child background contexts as needed.
///
/// - Warning:   I included this stack implementation as a superclass for other stacks.
///              But this stack can be used in multiple persistent store coordinators stacks
///              with `Roku` (its `masterObjectContext` is `PrivateQueueConcurrencyType`).
///
/// - Attention: In this setup the background or root context
///              should be used for the data import.
///
/// - Remark:    All properties are lazy-initialized.
///              All `ManagedObjectContext`'s changes are fully synchronized.
///              You may wish to inherit from this class to make your custom stack.
