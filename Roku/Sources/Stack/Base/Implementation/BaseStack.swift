/// Default `CoreData` stack implementation.
///
/// This stack consists of a main managed object context
/// initialized with the `MainQueueConcurrencyType`, and a background
/// managed object context initialized with the `PrivateQueueConcurrencyType`.
/// The main context is configured to be the parent context of the background context.
///
/// - Warning:   This is a not so smart solution you sometimes see or read about.
///              I included this stack implementation as a superclass for other stacks.
///
/// - Attention: In this setup the background context
///              should be used for the data import.
///
/// - Remark:    All properties are lazy-initialized.
///              All `ManagedObjectContext`'s changes are fully synchronized.
///              You may wish to inherit from this class to make your custom stack.
