/// Concurrent stack implementation with independent managed object contexts.
///
/// This stack consists of two independent managed object contexts
/// which are both connected to the same persistent store coordinator.
/// One of the contexts is set up on the main queue,
/// the other one on a background queue.
///
/// - Attention: In this setup the background context is used for the data import.
///              The setup is a more conservative stack which does not use
///              the relatively new feature of nested managed object contexts.
///              According to the [stacks perfomance comparison][Perfomance],
///              this is the fastest stack setup.
///
/// - Note:      Change propagation between the contexts is achieved by subscribing
///              to the `NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification` and calling
///              `mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification()` on the other context.
///
/// - Remark:    All properties are lazy-initialized.
///              All `ManagedObjectContext`'s changes are fully synchronized.
///
/// - SeeAlso:  `IndependentStackTemplate`, `BaseStack`, `NestedStack`, [Illustration](http://floriankugler.com/images/cd-stack-3-d53fc6f6.png)
